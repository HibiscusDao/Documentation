# What is Hibiscus DAO?

## **Mission: Build an open source end-to-end process for fully-transparent + community-owned apparel production.**

# Roadmap

### Build a Decentralized, Community-Curated Apparel Brand

Leverage in-house production supply chain + tech infrastructure to release Hibiscus’s first community-curated collection - becoming a community-directed decentralized apparel brand.

### Create Fashion Legos = Fork-able Garment Library

Create open source, end-to-end apparel production supply chain + tech infrastructure that allows creators to easily create new garments on existing bases - via on chain portfolios that can forked, remixed, and recombined.

### Enable the Fashion Creator Economy

Build cryptographic profit sharing into our fashion lego tooling - enabling the creator economy for apparel production by retaining and redistributing the value created in making and wearing apparel. 

### Enable Proof of Ethical Production

Eventually, we want to create a system of producing clothes that uses consensus-driven blockchain technology to verify products are being made ethically.

# Current Landscape of Apparel = Exploitation

The fashion industry is growing exponentially - without any signs of slowing down. 

The apparel and luxury market reached $1.9 trillion globally in 2019 - and is expected to surpass $3 trillion in the next decade.

However, the distribution of returns in the fashion industry is heavily skewed. This is because a traditional brand's business model is based around maximizing profit - by minimizing value returned to stakeholders.

### OLD SYSTEM VS NEW SYSTEM

**The traditional fashion industry is rooted in the exploitation of:** 

- **Manufacturers**
- **Designers**
- **The Environment**

### Traditional Fashion = Humanitarian Exploitation

Slave, child, and sweatshop labor are all common in the supply chain of traditional brands. These human rights violations are well-documented but suppressed via marketing and PR. 

The biggest offenders (like Nike and H&M) have been put under pressure to improve their behavior but there is no way (yet) to verify if garments are being produced ethically. 

### Traditional Fashion = Creative Exploitation

Talented young designers generate massive value for brands - often without compensation. And even when they are compensated, they are not paid relative to the value they create. 

A successful, popular design will earn a brand millions, yet the designer behind it will see none of these earnings. Instead, their designs become the IP of the brand. 

### Traditional Fashion = Environmental Exploitation

Fashion brands intentionally leverage planned obsolescence and instill an increasingly consumerist mindset based on overconsumption to feed their continued need for profit. 

When overconsumption is encouraged, true sustainability is impossible to achieve.

# Brands Obscure Exploitative Practices

> “So really it comes down to this, there’s an anonymity in the supply chain. 

> We don’t really know who, what, where and why —

> We know why we’re consuming it, we wanna consume it - but for the consumer it is virtually impossible to know whether a product was manufactured in safe conditions.**”
