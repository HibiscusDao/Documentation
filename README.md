# What is Hibiscus DAO

Mission: Build an open source end-to-end process for fully-transparent + community-owned apparel production.


### Build Decentralized Community Owned Apparel 
Leverage in-house production supply chain + tech infrastructure to release Hibiscus’s first community-curated collection - becoming a community-directed decentralized apparel brand.


### Create Fashion Legos = Fork-able Garment Library
Create open source, end-to-end apparel production supply chain + tech infrastructure that allows creators to easily create new garments on existing bases - via on chain portfolios that can forked, remixed, and recombined.


### Enable the Fashion Creator Economy
Build cryptographic profit sharing into our fashion lego tooling - enabling the creator economy for apparel production by retaining and redistributing the value created in making and wearing apparel.

### Enable Proof of Ethical Production
Eventually, we want to create a system of producing clothes that uses consensus-driven blockchain technology to verify products are being made ethically.


# Current Landscape of Apparel Production

The fashion industry is growing exponentially - without any signs of slowing down. 

The apparel and luxury market reached $1.9 trillion globally in 2019 - and is expected to surpass $3 trillion in the next decade.

However, the distribution of returns in the fashion industry is heavily skewed. This is because a traditional brand's business model is based around maximizing profit - by minimizing value returned to stakeholders. 

### Old System                      vs.                    New System

**The traditional fashion industry is rooted in the exploitation of:** 

- **Manufacturers**
- **Designers**
- **The Environment**


### Traditional Fashion = Humanitarian Exploitation

Slave, child, and sweatshop labor are all common in the supply chain of traditional brands. These human rights violations are well-documented but suppressed via marketing and PR.

The biggest offenders (like Nike and H&M) have been put under pressure to improve their behavior but there is no way (yet) to verify if garments are being produced ethically. 


### Traditional Fashion = Creative Exploitation

Talented young designers generate massive value for brands - often without compensation. And even when they are compensated, they are not paid relative to the value they create.

A successful, popular design will earn a brand millions, yet the designer behind it will see none of these earnings. Instead, their designs become the IP of the brand.


### Traditional Fashion = Environmental Exploitation

Fashion brands intentionally leverage planned obsolescence and instill an increasingly consumerist mindset based on overconsumption to feed their continued need for profit. 

When overconsumption is encouraged, true sustainability is impossible to achieve.



# Brands Obscure Exploitative Practices

> “So really it comes down to this, there’s an anonymity in the supply chain. 

****We don’t really know who, what, where and why —

****we know why we’re consuming it, we wanna consume it - but **for the consumer it is virtually impossible to know whether a product was manufactured in safe conditions.**”

### Today, the world’s biggest, most visible brands go to great lengths to obscure their fundamentally exploitative business practices via marketing.

They pour hundreds of millions into assuaging consumer guilt via manipulative messaging - without addressing the negative dynamics that make this type of marketing necessary in the first place.

**Beloved brands such as Nike, The North Face, and Patagonia churn out marketing campaigns convincing consumers that buying their products is equated with supporting anti-racism, ethical production, and sustainability.**

**At the same time:** 

- **Executive leadership teams of these brands remain largely white.**
- **Only ~1% of garments produced worldwide are done so by workers being paid living wages in their home countries.**
- **Most growth is created by a rate of consumption that no amount of recycling will offset.**

### And because we still aren't able to truly verify whether garments are being produced ethically - *everyone* in the industry is put in a compromising position:

A designer based in Los Angeles may be complicit in the exploitation and brutalization of a child laborer in Bangladesh... though they may never know it. 

# Solution: A New Trustless System

## A participant-owned system of producing clothes that uses consensus-driven blockchain technology to verify that products are being made ethically.

## Reinvention of Apparel Production via "Proof of Non-Slave Labor"

Building this new system will lift up creators and crafters - which can force traditional apparel brands into an "arms race" towards ethical production by driving adoption of a new industry standard of cryptographic verification in the supply chain. 

The traditional system of apparel production is fundamentally exploitative and requires reinvention. We view crypto technologies and philosophies, from fractional ownership, to tokenized licenses, to smart contracts, as the best tools for this job. 

Traditional brands benefiting from this status quo of exploitation will never willingly give up their profits for a more ethical alternative. We have to disrupt them and build a new system from the ground up. 

With blockchain technology - cloud-based crowdsourced human-rights oracles and "Proof of Location" protocols can validate safe and healthy work places.

Normalizing use of these human-rights oracles and verification protocols in apparel production would expose corporations for lack of "Proof of Non-Slave Labor".

### As “Proof of Non-Slave Labor” becomes an industry standard:

### Corporations who currently have a stranglehold on fashion would be forced to adopt ethical supply chain operations or admit - by omission - to using slave labor.

To make this a reality we need to research and apply protocols to power fully transparent on-chain apparel production. This enables a community owned, transparent, and innovative production process.

## Hibiscus DAO = Empowerment

We seek to normalize and facilitate: 

- Not using slave labor.
- Paying community/staff proportionally to their contributions
- On-boarding current industry players onto the blockchain (designers & makers)

With hope of creating: 

- Strong design teams driven by community and monetary value.
- More diversity, better ideas, better concepts, better curation, and more robust thinking.
- Momentum towards living on-chain.

## Hibiscus DAO = Ownership

Crypto technologies help share ownership with stakeholders: 

- Web3 communities can bring more value back to their creators when producing wearables
- Forkable concepts and tools can be validated and iterated on by community creators.
- Computer-aided designs can be registered on-chain as vectors and then used to produce anything from printed goods to cut & sew - enabling proper credit and compensation.
- Future royalties of products can be distributed back to creators and the community by the DAOs

## With an improved model we can build better to do more, produce less, and return value to creators and users.

Blockchains can redesign incentives to enable freedom, effectiveness, and teamwork: 

- Shareholders, makers and creators shouldn’t be in opposition.
- Effective products and social human rights shouldn’t be in opposition.
