# What is Hibiscus DAO

Mission: Build an open source end-to-end process for fully-transparent + community-owned apparel production.


### Build Decentralized Community Owned Apparel 
Leverage in-house production supply chain + tech infrastructure to release Hibiscusâ€™s first community-curated collection - becoming a community-directed decentralized apparel brand.


### Create Fashion Legos = Fork-able Garment Library
Create open source, end-to-end apparel production supply chain + tech infrastructure that allows creators to easily create new garments on existing bases - via on chain portfolios that can forked, remixed, and recombined.


### Enable the Fashion Creator Economy
Build cryptographic profit sharing into our fashion lego tooling - enabling the creator economy for apparel production by retaining and redistributing the value created in making and wearing apparel.

### Enable Proof of Ethical Production
Eventually, we want to create a system of producing clothes that uses consensus-driven blockchain technology to verify products are being made ethically.


# Current Landscape of Apparel = Exploitation

The fashion industry is growing exponentially - without any signs of slowing down. 

The apparel and luxury market reached $1.9 trillion globally in 2019 - and is expected to surpass $3 trillion in the next decade.

However, the distribution of returns in the fashion industry is heavily skewed. This is because a traditional brand's business model is based around maximizing profit - by minimizing value returned to stakeholders. 

### Old System                      vs.                    New System
