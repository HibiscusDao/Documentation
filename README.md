# What is Hibiscus DAO?

## **Mission: Build an open source end-to-end process for fully-transparent + community-owned apparel production.**

# Roadmap

### Build a Decentralized, Community-Curated Apparel Brand

Leverage in-house production supply chain + tech infrastructure to release Hibiscusâ€™s first community-curated collection - becoming a community-directed decentralized apparel brand.

### Create Fashion Legos = Fork-able Garment Library

Create open source, end-to-end apparel production supply chain + tech infrastructure that allows creators to easily create new garments on existing bases - via on chain portfolios that can forked, remixed, and recombined.

### Enable the Fashion Creator Economy

Build cryptographic profit sharing into our fashion lego tooling - enabling the creator economy for apparel production by retaining and redistributing the value created in making and wearing apparel. 

### Enable Proof of Ethical Production

Eventually, we want to create a system of producing clothes that uses consensus-driven blockchain technology to verify products are being made ethically.
